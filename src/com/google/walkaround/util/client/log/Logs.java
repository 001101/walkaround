/**
 * Client logging utility that supports lazy handlers, retention of a certain
 * amount of historical log entries, and two dimensions of filtering (streams
 * and levels).
 *
 * The implementation is designed to be efficient when expensive log rendering
 * is turned off, by avoiding unnecessary object creation. Handlers are
 * asynchronously notified that log events are available, and may choose to
 * ignore them (if they are inactive) or have all events pushed to them.
 *
 * The {@link Logs.Log} interface omits the stream name in its interface,
 * because it is intended to be a simple wrapper with the stream name curried in
 * for convenience, as generally each application component will use a single
 * stream name.
